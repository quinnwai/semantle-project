# The Semantle Project

Exploratory network analysis looking into semantic similarity in Semantle and Google 300 News pre-trained Word2Vec model. The `gephis` folder has a set of `gephi` files to visualize and the `images` folder has some finalized images of networks to view. To get the networks, run the code (unfortunately GitHub can't handle the network file sizes... Tough luck!)

_Note_: To run or edit the notebook, import the `semantle_similarity.ipynb` file into Google Colab and follow the instructions there.
